# 3.1 Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input
# to compute gross pay. Pay the hourly rate for the hours up to 40 and 1.5 times
# the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Use 45 hours and a rate
# of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). You should
# use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do
# not worry about error checking the user input - assume the user types numbers
# properly.
